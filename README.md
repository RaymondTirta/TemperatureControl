# TemperatureControl
This Project is for IoT Project to control temperature between 25C-50C with PID Control
This project use NTC Thermistor Sensor with arduino UNO with LCD I2C 16x2 and membrane keypad. 
This is a simple project with PID Control Library to control the temperature of the water with heater for on and off to maintain the temperature.
